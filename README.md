# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning, given medical attributes.

This project applies various Machine Learning and Data Science python-based tools like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn etc., to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not, given medical attributes.

Note: This project has been completely done on a Colab notebook, hence no environment setup in the github repo.

Cheers!

# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning.

This project applies various Machine Learning and Data Science python-based tools like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn etc., to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not, given medical attributes.

Note: This project has been completely done on a Colab notebook, hence no environment setup in the github repo.

## Approaches:
1) Problem Definition
2) Data
3) Evaluation
4) Features
5) Modelling
6) Experimentation

## 1. Problem Definition

Given the clinincal parameters such as age, sex, blood sugar level etc., is it possible to predict whether or not the patient has heart disease?

##2. Data

Data obtained from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease
